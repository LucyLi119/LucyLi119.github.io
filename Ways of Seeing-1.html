    In John Bergers article "ways of seeing" he talks about the different ways in which people perceive arts and the ways that art has changed during a time of emerging technological advancements. John specifically discusses about women in art in chapter three and how they have been perceived by viewers.Unlike man, woman's presence often expresses her attitude toward herself and what can or cannot be done to her. men symbolize power and women on the other hand, are always being watched by men. Sexulization of the female body not only appear in oil painting from centuries ago, they still exist even today in commercials or magzines. The first picture I found was an campaign photo by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, the four men in the picture are looking at the woman while she is laying on the floor wearing sexy outfit, and one of them presses the woman's hand on the floor as if she is dominanted by him. And in the second picture, the woman in the poser is holding two burgers in front of her breasts and this is a common advertising tactic that still exists today: using female body to catch attention from not only men but also women themselves.
